The project includes various data exploration and analysis tasks:

1-Basic data inspection (shape, columns, data types)

2-Unique weather conditions and their frequency

3-Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, variance) of different weather parameters

4-Filtering data based on specific conditions (e.g., snow events, high wind speed with specific visibility)

5-Grouping and aggregating data by weather conditions
