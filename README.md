Weather Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset of weather conditions recorded throughout 2012. The data includes various meteorological measurements taken at hourly intervals.

The project includes various data exploration and analysis tasks:

1-Basic data inspection (shape, columns, data types)

2-Unique weather conditions and their frequency

3-Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, variance) of different weather parameters

4-Filtering data based on specific conditions (e.g., snow events, high wind speed with specific visibility)

5-Grouping and aggregating data by weather conditions
